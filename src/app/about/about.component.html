      <p>Welcome! I'm a digital writer, artist and developer of playable stories. My digital fiction, Underbelly, won
        the <a href="http://newmediawritingprize.co.uk/?page_id=350">New Media Writing Prize 2010</a> and the
        MaMSIE Digital Media Competition 2011. My work is published in online journals and anthologies, including the
        <a
          href="http://collection.eliterature.org/2/index.html">Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 2</a> and the <a href="http://anthology.elmcip.net/">ELMCIP Anthology of European Electronic Literature</a>,
          and has been presented at international festivals, exhibitions and conferences. You can also see my work here in my
          <a [routerLink]="['/showcase']">showcase</a>.</p>

      <p>I'm currently doing a practice-based <a href="http://www.writingdigital.com/phd-students/">PhD in Digital Writing at Bath Spa University</a>,
        which is taking up most of my time, but I'm also Creative Director of e-learning specialists, Make It Happen. I'm based in the north of England.</p>
